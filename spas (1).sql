In a broader perspective, women empowerment includes every step taken in different walks of life, with the intention of making the women more empowered.\r\n\r\nThe Need for Women Empowerment\r\n\r\nSince centuries women around the world are subjected to various kinds of discrimination and atrocities at the hands of the men. They are more susceptible to domestic violence and considered inferior to the men.\r\n\r\nGirls in rural areas are not sent to the school as spending on the education of a girl is considered a failed investment and not necessary. On the other hand, boys are provided complete primary and elementary education and are seen as the backbone of the family and society.\r\n\r\nEconomic Empowerment of Women\r\n\r\nEconomic empowerment of women refers to making the women economically independent by developing their skills and making them employable. Policymakers work together with NGOs and other relevant organizations to arrange programs for women education and skill improvement, so that they can be either gainfully employed or do a business of their own.\r\n\r\nThe financial independence of women is the first step towards improving their social status and self-esteem. Unless women become independent in fending for themselves and their families, all talks of women empowerment are useless.\r\n\r\nPolitical Empowerment of Women\r\n\r\nPolitical empowerment refers to the involvement of women in parliamentary positions and policymaking. As per 2017 estimates, women constitute around 23.6% of parliamentary positions, globally.\r\n\r\nSome methods of political empowerment of women are providing them the right to vote and allowing them to run high offices. Making reservations for the women in parliaments and other constitutional positions will help increase their stake in the political and administrative sphere.', 'Women empowerment includes education, equal growth, and employment opportunities for women equivalent to the men in society. Economic empowerment of women involves making women economically independent by developing their skills and employing them. Political empowerment of women involves their participation in parliamentary positions and policymaking.', 14),

It refers to their social, political, educational, medical, economical and other forms of improvement.

It is only through education that women gain access to better opportunities and income. Without education, they are forced to take up low paying jobs and always remain dependent on the men for their needs.\r\n\r\nEducation is the only tool to make women financially independent and able to make financial decisions of their own. An educated woman is able to pursue her own dream and decide about her life and career.\r\n\r\nWomen Empowerment and Sustainable Development\r\n\r\nWomen empowerment is a key factor in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. SDG goal number 5 targets gender equality and women empowerment as the fundamental requirements for an equitable society and bringing sustainable development.\r\n\r\nWomen around the world share the primary responsibilities of nutrition of the children, their education, and the management of the household.
